NARRA is a collaborative, extensible, free software for visualizing, annotating and linking audio-visual media (video, photos, sounds) and text.

We imagine it as a tool for those using large amounts of video in their practice â€“ artists exploring open narratives, video editors, social scientists using video as a research tool, documentary filmmakers with expanded projects.
